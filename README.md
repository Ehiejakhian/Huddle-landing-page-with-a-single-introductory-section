## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

## My process
After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS or Comic Relief as my font during design because it feels relaxing to my eyes and it helps me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Funny and weird, right?üòÅ

With SASS, I create mixins and partials to modularize my code. It helps me think and scroll through code with a simple mind.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my first time using font Awesome icons. I learned how to create a kit and reference it using the ```script```  tag provided by font awesome. It was fun!

### Continued development

I had some problems though with the background of the desktop screen sizes. I set the size to contain and cover many times just to try get the design. It almost ruined me. I want to get better at that next time.


## Author
For now I don't have a website of my own, but I am working on having one soon. It's very important.
